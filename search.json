    "title": "The Luka Doncic Trade Has Left The Mavericks In Shambles",
    "section": "",
    "text": "On a cold winter day in February 2025, Luka Doncic was traded from the Dallas Mavericks to the Los Angeles Lakers in a trade that shocked the sports world. Doncic was already an established star within the league, and only a year prior had led the Mavs to the finals, where they would dominated by the Boston Celtics.\nWhile the Lakers seemingly won the trade the Mavericks also received a star player in return. As a result of the trade the Mavericks landed Anthony Davis, Max Christie, as well as being positioned to receive the first overall pick in the 2025 NBA draft, landing Cooper Flagg. While the trade had benefits for both teams it’s clear by points per game alone that the Mavericks didn’t receive anyone near the caliber of Luka.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(scales)\n\nNBAscoring &lt;- read_csv(\"data/ScoringAvg.csv\")\n\nDoncic &lt;- NBAscoring |&gt; filter(Player == \"Luka Dončić\")\nFlagg &lt;- NBAscoring |&gt; filter(Player == \"Cooper Flagg\")\nChristie &lt;- NBAscoring |&gt; filter(Player == \"Max Christie\")\n\nggplot() + geom_point(data=NBAscoring, aes(x=PTS, y=FGPCT, size = AST), color=\"gray\")+geom_point(data=Doncic, aes(x=PTS, y=FGPCT, size=AST),color=\"purple\")+ geom_text_repel(data=Doncic, aes(x=36, y=.44, label=Player))+geom_point(data=Flagg, aes(x=PTS, y=FGPCT, size=AST),color=\"blue\")+geom_text_repel(data=Flagg, aes(x=PTS, y=FGPCT, label=Player)) +geom_point(data=Christie, aes(x=PTS, y=FGPCT, size=AST),color=\"blue\")+ geom_text_repel(data=Christie, aes(x=PTS, y=FGPCT+.01, label=Player)) +\nscale_y_continuous(labels = percent) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Points Per Game\", \n    y=\"Field Goal Percentage\", \n    title=\"Luka leads the NBA in Points Per Game\", \n    subtitle=\"Luka Doncic leads the NBA in scoring, far ahead of the player the Mavs recieved from the trade\", \n    caption=\"Source: NBA Sports Reference | By Jack Dynek\"\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal()+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the individual impact of the players is interesting to see, what matters most is team success. Since the trade happened at the midway point of the 2024-25 season a great metric to look at is how the teams compare in points per game. Given that both teams have had a full offseason since the trade their teams have acclimated to their new personnel, thus giving a more accurate representation of their teams.\n\n\nCode\nNBAscore &lt;- read_csv(\"data/ConsolidatedScoring.csv\")\nMavsScore &lt;- NBAscore |&gt; filter(Team == \"Dallas Mavericks\")\nLakersScore &lt;- NBAscore |&gt; filter(Team == \"Los Angeles Lakers\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=NBAscore, aes(x=Season, y=PTSPG, group=Team), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=NBAscore, aes(x=Season, y=PTSPG, group=Team), color=\"grey\")+\n  geom_line(data=MavsScore, aes(x=Season, y=PTSPG, group=Team), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_point(data=MavsScore, aes(x=Season, y=PTSPG, group=Team), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_line(data=LakersScore, aes(x=Season, y=PTSPG, group=Team), color=\"purple\") +\n  geom_point(data=LakersScore, aes(x=Season, y=PTSPG, group=Team), color=\"purple\") +\ngeom_text(data=MavsScore |&gt; filter(Season == max(Season)), aes(x=Season + .24, y=PTSPG+.1, group=Team, label=Team)) + \n  geom_text(data=MavsScore |&gt; filter(Season == min(Season)), aes(x=Season - .24, y=PTSPG, group=Team, label=Team)) + \n  geom_text(data=LakersScore |&gt; filter(Season == max(Season)), aes(x=Season + .24, y=PTSPG+.1, group=Team, label=Team)) + \n  geom_text(data=LakersScore |&gt; filter(Season == min(Season)), aes(x=Season - .24, y=PTSPG-.1, group=Team, label=Team)) + \n    scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2024, 2025), limits=c(2023.5,2025.5)) + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Season\", \n    y=\"PTS Scored per game\", \n    title=\"The Mavericks have struggled offensively post trade\", \n    subtitle=\"In the year following the trade the Lakers have only improved on offense while the\\n Mavs have regressed\", \n    caption=\"Source: NFL Sports Reference | By Jack Dynek\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs seen in the graph, the impact of Luka on the Lakers has led them to great offensive success while leaving the Mavs in shambles. While seeing the impact after a whole year can be helpful, whats even more interesting is seeing how the teams both immediately played after the trade happened, especially comparing their scoring.\n\n\nCode\ngamelogs &lt;- read_csv(\"data/GameScoreCumulative.csv\")\n\ndiffgame &lt;- gamelogs |&gt;\n  group_by(Team) |&gt;\n  mutate(TotalPTS = cumsum(Points))\n\nLakersCumulative &lt;- diffgame |&gt; filter(Team == \"Los Angeles Lakers\")\nMavsCumulative &lt;- diffgame |&gt; filter(Team == \"Dallas Mavericks\")\n  \nggplot() + geom_step(data=diffgame, aes(x=Game, y=Points, group=Team)) +\ngeom_step(data=MavsCumulative, aes(x=Game, y=Points, group=Team), color=\"darkblue\") + \ngeom_step(data=LakersCumulative, aes(x=Game, y=Points, group=Team), color=\"yellow\") +\ngeom_text(data=MavsCumulative, aes(x=9.5, y=98, label=Team))+\ngeom_text(data=LakersCumulative, aes(x=9.4, y=112, label=Team))+\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(1,10)) + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Game Since Trade\", \n    y=\"PTS Scored per game\", \n    title=\"Lakers outpaced the Mavs in scoring post trade\", \n    subtitle=\"While the Scoring is eratic, the Mavericks experienced a brief boost before\\n regression while the lakers scored more\", \n    caption=\"Source: NFL Sports Reference | By Jack Dynek\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the games that would follow the Lakers would improve over the Mavericks but have a lot of variety of their own, while the Mavs had an initial peak and then a deep decline.\nOverall, this was one of the biggest trades in NBA history. Sending a young established superstar to another team just months after a finals run, and creating chaos in Dallas to the point of GM Nico Harrison losing his job. It’s a trade that will be remembered for it’s one sided nature and a player that continues to play at his peak despite the turmoil, while potentially becoming an all-time great."

    "text": "The Indianapolis Colts in the course of one offseason have taken a team that was nearly unwatchable, to an extremely exciting offense.\nThrough 10 games Daniel Jones is third in the league in Passing Yards, while Jonathan Taylor is leading the league by nearly 200 Rushing Yards as he looks to win his first Offensive Player of the Year and hopefully an MVP. But those stats understate how good this team has been.\nWith last years team being 8-9 and incredibly boring to watch, this team already has 8 wins. With a turnaround like this fans have to wonder what changed for the colts. One statistic immediately jumps out this year compared to last for the colts, and that’s their Percentages of drives ending in scores.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nscoring &lt;- read_csv(\"ScoringDrives - Sheet1.csv\")\nColtsScore &lt;- scoring |&gt; filter(Team == \"Indianapolis Colts\")\nChiefsScore &lt;- scoring |&gt; filter (Team == \"Kansas City Chiefs\")\nEaglesScore &lt;- scoring |&gt; filter(Team == \"Philadelphia Eagles\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=scoring, aes(x=Season, y=ScoringDrives, group=Team), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=scoring, aes(x=Season, y=ScoringDrives, group=Team), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_line(data=ColtsScore, aes(x=Season, y=ScoringDrives, group=Team), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_point(data=ColtsScore, aes(x=Season, y=ScoringDrives, group=Team), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_line(data=ChiefsScore, aes(x=Season, y=ScoringDrives, group=Team), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(data=ChiefsScore, aes(x=Season, y=ScoringDrives, group=Team), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_line(data=EaglesScore, aes(x=Season, y=ScoringDrives, group=Team), color=\"darkgreen\") +\n  geom_point(data=EaglesScore, aes(x=Season, y=ScoringDrives, group=Team), color=\"darkgreen\") +geom_text(data=ColtsScore |&gt; filter(Season == max(Season)), aes(x=Season + .22, y=ScoringDrives+.1, group=Team, label=Team)) + \n  geom_text(data=ColtsScore |&gt; filter(Season == min(Season)), aes(x=Season - .22, y=ScoringDrives, group=Team, label=Team)) + \n  geom_text(data=ChiefsScore |&gt; filter(Season == max(Season)), aes(x=Season + .24, y=ScoringDrives, group=Team, label=Team)) + \n  geom_text(data=ChiefsScore |&gt; filter(Season == min(Season)), aes(x=Season - .24, y=ScoringDrives, group=Team, label=Team)) + \n  geom_text(data=EaglesScore |&gt; filter(Season == max(Season)), aes(x=Season + .24, y=ScoringDrives, group=Team, label=Team)) + \n  geom_text(data=EaglesScore |&gt; filter(Season == min(Season)), aes(x=Season - .24, y=ScoringDrives, group=Team, label=Team)) + \n    scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2024, 2025), limits=c(2023.5,2025.5)) + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Season\", \n    y=\"Percentage of drives ending in scores\", \n    title=\"NFL Offense's drives ending in scores\", \n    subtitle=\"This is how the Colts compare against the past years Superbowl matchup.\", \n    caption=\"Source: NFL Sports Reference | By Jack Dynek\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see the colts have made a major jump. going from bottom middle of the pack. To leading the league by over 6% of drives. With a turnaround like that it’s no wonder why this team is so much more successful. Beyond just that though their success can be reflected in how many more yards they’re averaging per game.\n\n\nCode\ngame824 &lt;- read_csv(\"2024_8game.csv\")\ngame825 &lt;- read_csv(\"2025_8game.csv\")\n\n\nlongame824 &lt;- (game824) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=starts_with(\"Offense\"),\n    names_to=\"Type\",\n    values_to=\"Yards\"\n  )\nlongame825 &lt;- (game825) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=starts_with(\"Offense\"),\n    names_to=\"Type\",\n    values_to=\"Yards\"\n  )\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=longame824, aes(x=Week, weight=Yards, fill=Type)) + geom_hline(yintercept=315, color=\"blue\") +\n  coord_flip()+ \n  labs(\n    x=\"Week\", \n    y=\"Offensive Yards Per Game\", \n    title=\"Colts First 8 Games on Offense in 2024\", \n    subtitle=\"This shows how the Colts pass and rushing yards each game to start 2024.\", \n    caption=\"Source: NFL Sports Reference | By Jack Dynek\"\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal()+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the start to the colts season in 2024, and through eight games they averaged 315 yards, represented by the blue line, and relied heavily on the pass game, only going over 400 yards once.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=longame825, aes(x=Week, weight=Yards, fill=Type)) + \n  coord_flip()+  geom_hline(yintercept=383.33, color=\"black\") + geom_hline(yintercept=315, color=\"blue\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Week\", \n    y=\"Offensive Yards Per Game\", \n    title=\"Colts First 8 Games on Offense in 2025\", \n    subtitle=\"This shows how the Colts pass and rushing yards each game to start 2025.\", \n    caption=\"Source: NFL Sports Reference | By Jack Dynek\"\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal()+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis on the other hand is the 2025 Colts year. They averaged 383 yards a game and have already had four games over 400 total yards with plenty of dominant performances from both the run and pass game.\nOne player that has directly led to Colts passing game improving is Tyler Warren. Through eight games he already has more recieving yards than the entire Colts tight end room had last year in the entire season.

He has been dominant to begin the season and leads all running backs in yards and touchdowns.This data accounts for his first 9 games prior to his dominant performance against the Falcons, but still illustrates his spectacular year.\n\n\nCode\nrushing &lt;- read_csv(\"rushing_2025.csv\")\n\nJT &lt;- rushing |&gt; filter(Player == \"Jonathan Taylor\")\nCMC &lt;- rushing |&gt; filter(Player == \"Christian McCaffrey\")\n\nggplot() + geom_point(data=rushing, aes(x=Yds, y=Att, size=TD )) + geom_point(data=JT, aes(x=Yds, y=Att, size=TD),color=\"blue\")+ geom_text(data=JT, aes(x=775, y=161, label=Player)) + geom_point(data=CMC, aes(x=Yds, y=Att, size=TD),color=\"darkred\")+ geom_text(data=CMC, aes(x=525, y=161, label=Player))+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Rushing Yards\", \n    y=\"Rushing Attempts\", \n    title=\"NFL Rushing Leaders\", \n    subtitle=\"This is how Jonathan Taylor compares statistically against other RBS\", \n    caption=\"Source: NFL Sports Reference | By Jack Dynek\"\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of these combine to show how the colts have improved to be a much better team than they were in the 2024 season and time will tell how they finish out the remainder of the year."
